# Branding Only NavBar

The Navigation Bar expects a brand name and will produce a basic Bootstrap NavBar object to display this.

# Basic NavBar

It is expected that any tool built using this framework will consist of multiple pages and so the Navigational bar will include a second row holding links to these pages. Currently the links expect to use the React Router component to generate.
